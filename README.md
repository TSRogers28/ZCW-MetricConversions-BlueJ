## Conversion Tool

This tool converts different units of measure. Methods have been stubbed out to convert the following:

- Centimeters <-> Inches
- Feet <-> Meters
- Celcius <-> Fahrenheit
- MPH <-> KPH

This tool should only convert positive numbers. Any negative numbers that are passed should return 0 (This excludes temperature conversions, negative values can be converted) 

Complete the implementation so that all test pass
